  <div class="cbt-body">
    Your Thrive therapist will encourage you to talk about your thoughts and
    feelings and what's troubling you. Don't worry if you find it hard to open
    up about your feelings. Your therapist can help you gain more confidence and
    comfort. CBT generally focuses on specific problems, using a goal-oriented
    approach. As you go through the therapy process, your therapist may ask you
    to do "homework" — activities, reading or practices that build on what you
    learn during your regular therapy sessions — and encourage you to apply what
    you're learning in your daily life. Your therapist's approach will depend on
    your particular situation and preferences. Your therapist may combine CBT
    with another therapeutic approach.

  <p class="cbt-title col-md-5 offset-3 mt-3">STEPS IN CBT</p>
  <div class="cbt-body">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Identify troubling situations or conditions in your life. </b>These
        may include such issues as a medical condition, divorce, grief, anger or
        symptoms of a mental illness. You and your therapist may spend some time
        deciding what problems and goals you want to focus on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Become aware of your thoughts, emotions and beliefs about these
          problems. </b
        >Once you've identified the problems to work on, your therapist will
        encourage you to share your thoughts about them. This may include
        observing what you tell yourself about an experience (self-talk), your
        interpretation of the meaning of a situation, and your beliefs about
        yourself, other people and events. Your therapist may suggest that you
        keep a journal of your thoughts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Identify negative or inaccurate thinking.</b>To help you recognize
        patterns of thinking and behavior that may be contributing to your
        problem, your therapist may ask you to pay attention to your physical,
        emotional and behavioral responses in different situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reshape negative or inaccurate thinking.</b> Your therapist will
        likely encourage you to ask yourself whether your view of a situation is
        based on fact or on an inaccurate perception of what's going on. This
        step can be difficult. You may have long-standing ways of thinking about
        your life and yourself. With practice, helpful thinking and behavior
        patterns will become a habit and won't take as much effort.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="cbt-body">
    Cognitive behavioral therapy may not cure your condition or make an
    unpleasant situation go away. But it can give you the power to cope with
    your situation in a healthy way and to feel better about yourself and your
    life.
